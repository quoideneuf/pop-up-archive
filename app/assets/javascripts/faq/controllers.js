					question: "What is Pop Up Archive? Who is it for?",
					answer: "Pop Up Archive is a platform of tools for organizing and searching digital spoken word. We process sound for a wide range of customers, from large archives and universities to media companies, radio stations, and podcast networks. Drag and drop any audio file (or let us ingest your RSS, SoundCloud, or iTunes feed), and within minutes receive automatically generated transcripts and tags. Pop Up Archive transcripts help producers log and search their raw tape, repurpose audio stories into text posts faster, add text content to stations’ websites, and ensure that audio and video get indexed by Google for the most innovative digital media properties.",
				},
				{
					question: "How does Pop Up Archive compare to human transcription?",
					answer: "The short answer is that automatic transcription is usually less accurate than human transcription. But getting verbatim human transcripts is expensive, slow and labor-intensive — and search engines don’t need perfect transcripts. There are ways to be smart about interpreting messy output, and to use that data to extract relevant keywords and metadata. It’s like magic: When you pair text content with timestamps, audio becomes browsable. Harnessed the right way, speech-to-text software means effortless access to crucial keywords and moments hidden deep within hours of content.",

			title: "Transcripts and Audio Quality",
			link: "transcripts",
			questions: [
				{
					question: "What are premium transcripts?", 
					answer: "Premium transcripts use automatic speech recognition software to create time-stamped text and keyword tags from audio. Other features include speaker differentiation (in beta), punctuation, and capitalization. The software is trained on a large corpus of broadcast and oral history voices, and is updated regularly for current names and vocabulary. Transcripts are generated in real time (e.g. a hour audio file will be processed in approximately one hour). Accuracy varies depending on factors like audio quality and speaker dialect, so often the best way to guage accuracy for your audio is to try it out for yourself."
				},
				{
					question: "What languages and accents does Pop Up Archive support?",
					answer: "Pop Up Archive's speech-to-text software currently only supports English language audio. We hope to expand to Spanish language and other major languages in 2015. Because our transcription software is trained on voices from mass media, both Premium and Basic software performs best for dialects heavily represented in American and British broadcast media. That said, feel free to try us out with any accents you've got, and let us know how it goes!",
				},
				{
					question: "Why do the automatic transcripts and tags have errors?",
					answer: "Automatically generated transcripts rely on software to make a guess about what's being said in your audio file. Your transcript will have more or less errors depending on the quality of the audio. For instance, broadcast-quality news productions and interviews recorded with high-quality equipment result in the most accurate transcripts because there is little background noise.",
				},
				{
					question: "What affects transcript quality?",
					answer: "Transcript quality may be adversely affected by the subject speaking quickly, with an accent, or mumbling; multiple speakers speaking at the same time; background noise; or background music tracks. Pop Up Archive also uses keyword extraction tools that pull useful terms from your transcripts, so even if your transcripts aren't perfect, we can still extract valuable information from them.",
